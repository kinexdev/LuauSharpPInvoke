CMake project that is used for compiling luau into a dll that can be used to create luau language bindings specifically for C#.
For precompiled binaries and abstractions, visit the [LuauSharp](https://github.com/KinexDev/LuauSharp) repo.
This should be cross-platform too, you can compile these to any platform with hopefully no issues, which is partly why i made this.
