CMake project that is used for compiling luau into a dll that can be used in Luau-CSharp by languages.

For precompiled binaries and abstractions, visit the [Luau-CSharp](https://github.com/KinexDev/Luau-CSharp) repo.

This should be cross-platform too, you can compile these to any platform with hopefully no issues, which is partly why i made this.
